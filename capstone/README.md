# WISHBOURNE
Make a wish from a celebrity by creating a crowdfunding campaign.

## Project Details
Our project aims to create a platform on the Solana Blockchain where users can propose tasks or requests for celebrities and content creators through crowdfunding. Each topic can be supported with a donation of 1 USDC. When a task is completed, the content creator receives the pooled funds. Our app will facilitate this process, enabling users to create, view, and contribute to crowdfunding topics easily. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to provide transparency, security, and efficiency in the crowdfunding process. This project allows users to engage directly with their favorite influencers and offers content creators a decentralized way to monetize their work.

Our goal is to enhance interaction with content creators by introducing a crowdfunding platform on the Solana Blockchain. This project offers a direct way for people to engage with their favorite influencers, propose tasks, and support creators financially. By democratizing the process, we enable users to influence content creation and build connections with their idols. Through transparency and decentralization, we aim to build a community where creativity can flourish, leading to meaningful collaborations and innovative content. Together, weâ€™re working to improve online interaction and make wishes come true for both creators and their audience.
